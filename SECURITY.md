# Puter AI PWA Security Policy

## AI messages

None of your messages are permanently stored on a server.
They are only locally saved in RAM for the chat history in app, and are deleted when exiting the app.

## Puter

Some data is shared with **Puter**, since this app is powered by **Puter.js** :
* The message you sent (not saved) : Temporarly saved on Puter's server to allow the AI to read your message and generate an answer. The message is deleted from the server once the AI answered.
* Your Puter account (saved on Puter's server) : This app requires a Puter account to work, and Puter accounts are permanently saved on Puter's servers. If you want to delete your Puter account and all of the data, please go to [puter.com](https://puter.com), open the settings, and follow the instructions to delete your account.
