## Functionalities

It can talk multiple languages.

## Account
Puter AI needs a **Puter account**.

Each Puter accout have **1000 ai credits per month** (1 message = 1 credit)

If you want to use your already existing Puter account, or sign out, click the `Settings` button, then click `Log out of your Puter account`

If you want to create a Puter account, go to [puter.com](https://puter.com)

## Powered by Puter
This app would not be possible without **Puter**.

In case you don't know what is Puter, its a web based operating system, like a computer in the cloud.

And Puter have a SDK called **[Puter.js](https://docs.puter.com/)**, allowing any website to have access to AI functionnalities, and store files on the user's Puter PC. And Puter is open source too !

## Other informations
### Special files
The main app is the `index.html` file, but you might have noticed `index-iframe.html` and `index-puter.html`. Thoses are for the following reasons :
* `index-iframe.html` is a modified version of `index.html`, **removing the settings button**, and replacing it with a "Open full app" button. Useful when integrating the app in a website.
* `index-puter.html` is a modified version of `index.html`, **completly deleting** the settings button. Made for being in a Puter app.

### Hosting
While this app is powered by Puter, it is also **hosted on Puter** !

In Puter, you can just right click a folder and publish it as a website, so thats how this is hosted.
